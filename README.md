A clone of Netflix as a try to remake the site with react and firebase, the site doesn't have any videos or films, its just a test video that will be played every time the user click on a movie.
the site it self is just a Create-React-App application and firebase is used to signing in and out, creating users and authenticating, for sure there is much more node packages used in it which you can see in the dependencies.
To install Essflix on your computer and to be able to start it with node, you need to clone done this repo from github, then open your terminal on the path where you have the folder in your pc, then run the command "npm init", wait a bit while npm install all the dependencies in the project, when its done, run the command "npm start", which will open your web browser with this application running.
Thank you.
